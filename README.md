## Project 1: Math Tutorial Website

In this project was creating very first version of the web site oriented for practicing skills in **HTML** and **CSS**.

Also it has a **menu** with some **links** inside it, a **content's box** with a couple of **sidebars** a left one and a right one. Inside each one there is a **list of items** styled using some nice colors transitions and pictures. And finally it has a nice **footer**.

## Project 2: Math Game


In this session has been created a game using **HTML**,  **CSS** and  **JS**.

This game is going to check how well our users know their **Multiplication Table up to 10**.

It is decorated with a nice **Welcome picture** and **Music** which starts once we click on the volume sign and can be stop with the repeated click. Note that the icon of a player is changing according to the status of playing music.

The game starts with pressing **Start** button. 

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28005338/48586431-37e11500-e930-11e8-9492-7b36bb133352.png)

Right after we will see our game field with the **First Question**, which is going to be a multiplication operation consisting of two numbers between 1 and 10 and a **Countdown** starting.

We have a few boxes with the possible answer and we need to pick up the right one. If we choose the right answer then we're going to get a green message ``Correct`` and  our score will increase by 1. 

![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28005338/48586485-62cb6900-e930-11e8-8c89-cf228e92e676.png)

If we pick up the wrong answer then we get a read message ``Try Again!`` and got **-3 sec** to our countdown time. It will leads till we choose the correct answer. Then the score goes up by 1 again and we will get a new question.

We can reset the game any time by clicking on the **Reset** button.

The game is going for a 60 sec and once we are out of time, then we're going to get a nice **Game Over** message saying our score.

## Project 3: Fruits Game


In this session has been created a game using **HTML**,  **CSS**,  **JS** and **JQuery**.


Once we click on the **Start Button** fruits start falling down from the upper part of the screen and we are
supposed to slice them in order to get points:

- if we sliced the fruit our score goes up by 1;

- if we missed the fruit then we're going to lose one trial (which is indicated at the left upper side of the screen as an amount of hearts corresponds to the amount of the trials left). 

![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28005338/49036385-e51d1e00-f1b7-11e8-8cfb-3fa0637b84ed.png)

Once we lose all the three initial trials then it is going to be **Game Over**.

![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28005338/49036436-0716a080-f1b8-11e8-897c-2213daa9a927.png)

The game is decorated with a sound of slicing fruit which plays once we do such a movement. Fruits falling down with an arbitrary speed and from the arbitrary part of the upper border (bounded by the game window).


The structure and initial decoration based on the **Project 2**, but the mechanism of the game has been significantly changed according to game needs.
