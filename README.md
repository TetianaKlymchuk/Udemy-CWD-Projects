## Project 2: Math Game


In this session has been created a game using **HTML**,  **CSS** and  **JS**.

This game is going to check how well our users know their **Multiplication Table up to 10**.

It is decorated with a nice **Welcome picture** and **Music** which starts once we click on the volume sign and can be stop with the repeated click. Note that the icon of a player is changing according to the status of playing music.

![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28005338/48587134-59db9700-e932-11e8-9b18-5bebafea32ff.png)


![7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28005338/48587137-5cd68780-e932-11e8-93d9-7b598e3db6d8.png)

The game starts with pressing **Start** button. 

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28005338/48586431-37e11500-e930-11e8-9492-7b36bb133352.png)

Right after we will see our game field with the **First Question**, which is going to be a multiplication operation consisting of two numbers between 1 and 10 and a **Countdown** starting. 

![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28005338/48586459-4e876c00-e930-11e8-92d7-e12951c962ff.png)

We have a few boxes with the possible answer and we need to pick up the right one. If we choose the right answer then we're going to get a green message ``Correct`` and  our score will increase by 1. 

![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28005338/48586485-62cb6900-e930-11e8-8c89-cf228e92e676.png)

If we pick up the wrong answer then we get a read message ``Try Again!`` and got **-3 sec** to our countdown time. It will leads till we choose the correct answer. Then the score goes up by 1 again and we will get a new question.

![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28005338/48586836-5693db80-e931-11e8-8e3f-24fb506bf03a.png)

We can reset the game any time by clicking on the **Reset** button.

The game is going for a 60 sec and once we are out of time, then we're going to get a nice **Game Over** message saying our score.

![5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28005338/48586521-7bd41a00-e930-11e8-91d5-1fc943819a9a.png)




## Project 3: Fruits Game


In this session has been created a game using **HTML**,  **CSS**,  **JS** and **JQuery**.


Once we click on the **Start Button** fruits start falling down from the upper part of the screen and we are
supposed to slice them in order to get points:

- if we sliced the fruit our score goes up by 1;

- if we missed the fruit then we're going to lose one trial (which is indicated at the left upper side of the screen as an amount of hearts corresponds to the amount of the trials left). 

![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28005338/49036385-e51d1e00-f1b7-11e8-8cfb-3fa0637b84ed.png)

Once we lose all the three initial trials then it is going to be **Game Over**.

![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28005338/49036436-0716a080-f1b8-11e8-897c-2213daa9a927.png)

The game is decorated with a sound of slicing fruit which plays once we do such a movement. Fruits falling down with an arbitrary speed and from the arbitrary part of the upper border (bounded by the game window).


The structure and initial decoration based on the **Project 2**, but the mechanism of the game has been significantly changed according to game needs.


## Project 4: Application Landing Page 

In this session has been created a nice starting web-page using **HTML**,  **CSS** and **Bootstrap**.

- the time counter and 

- the lap counter.

If we click on the **Stop** button both counters are stopped and we can resume again by clicking on

the **Resume** item.

If we click on the **Lap** button then the lap time is restarting and 
we see the information about the previous lap in the list in the bottom of the page:

The message has been shown to the user contains the following information:

**FILE:** File name;

**FILE TYPE:** File type;

**TEMPORARY LOCATION:** /...;

**FILE SIZE:** file size.

**PERMANENT DESTINATION:** uploads/fileName.fileType.

In this session you are going to create a professional up calculating traveling distances between cities


## Project 11: 'Distance betwen cities App.'

In this project has been practice mosly a usage of Google Maps API.

![screenshot at dec 23 21-30-40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28005338/50425161-6af0bf80-0871-11e9-809c-89ab3676df10.png)

Its an application which calculates a distance between two input cities, showes a map with a driving road on it and
separately shows a distance in miles and approximate driving time in a separate inside box.


![screenshot at dec 23 21-31-40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28005338/50425164-70e6a080-0871-11e9-8d24-9a806960f489.png)

The user needs to fill in the origin and the destination fields.

Once they start typing a city they get a few choices to pick up from an autocomplete.


![screenshot at dec 23 21-31-07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28005338/50425163-6e844680-0871-11e9-99c2-6ad1320e0e37.png)

If for some reason one of the input field is empty then an error message will appears instead of the box with the info,
otherwise all the information with the duration and road appears.

![screenshot at dec 23 21-31-58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28005338/50425165-7348fa80-0871-11e9-93bb-6f5b31cc9382.png)

The Application is adaptive to different sizes of a screen:
